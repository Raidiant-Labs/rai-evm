# Raidiant Security Policy

## Reporting a Security Bug

If you think you have discovered a security issue in any of the Raidiant projects, we'd love to
hear from you. We will take all security bugs seriously and if confirmed upon investigation we will
patch it within a reasonable amount of time and release a public security bulletin discussing the
impact and credit the discoverer.

Raidiant accepts security bug reports via email at [security at raidiant dot io](mailto:security@raidiant.io)
When sending information please be sure to include a description of the flaw and any related information (e.g. reproduction steps, version, known active use).
